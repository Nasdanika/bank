# Nasdanika Bank

Nasdanika Bank is a model-driven web application which purpose is to demonstrate how to build model-driven web applications with Eclipse and Nasdanika technologies and tools.

In particular:

* Generate workspace projects in [Nasdanika Tool Suite](../tools/index.html) with the [Workspace Wizard](../workspace-wizard/index.html).
* Capture domain knowledge in documented Ecore models.
* Generate [HTML documentation](modeldoc/index.html) from those models with [Docgen Ecore](../docgen-ecore/index.html).
* Capture requirements as user stories in [story models](../story/index.html) and then generate and publish story model documentation.
* Annotate the model with Web UI annotations.
* Create a Web UI model with [Codegen Ecore](../codegen-ecore/index.html) and its [Codegen Ecore Web UI](../codegen-ecore-web-ui/index.html) extension.
* Generate Web UI classes from the model.
* Generate Web UI model documentation and publish to the site.
* Run the application in Eclipse IDE.
* Build and run the application locally.
* Build the application on CircleCI.
* Deploy to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) cloud application platform.
* Create automated UI tests, run them with [WebTest](../webtest/index.html), and link test results with screenshots to the story documentation.        

The above steps are covered in detail in the [developer guide](guides/developer/index.html).
