# Modeling

Work in progress

Explain options:

- Diagrams/Modeling perspective - configure - convert to modeling project - viewpoint selection - design - right click on the model - add representation. Add reference to documentation.
- Tree editor - when a model becomes too large or in the "refinement" mode - a matter of preference, layout.

Model documentation generation - reference Docgen ecore.
